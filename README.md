# Wordle 🎮

- Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word 🤔, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match ✅ or occupy the correct position 🤏.

## How to Play Wordle ❓

- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. 📝

- The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was. 

- If the tile turns green 🟢, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot. 

- If the tile turns yellow 🟡, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

- If the tile turns gray ⚫, the letter is not in the word.
