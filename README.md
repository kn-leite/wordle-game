# Wordle

- Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

## How to Play Wordle

- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.

- The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.

- If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.

- If the tile turns yellow, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

- If the tile turns gray, the letter is not in the word.
